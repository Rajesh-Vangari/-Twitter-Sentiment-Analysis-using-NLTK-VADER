# 💬Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-using-NLTK-VADER

📖 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on tweets using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) sentiment analysis tool provided by the NLTK library. The main goal is to identify the emotional tone behind the tweets—whether they are positive, negative, or neutral. This is achieved by preprocessing the tweet text, applying VADER to generate sentiment scores, classifying the sentiment category, and visualizing the results using data visualization libraries.

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
The dataset used in this project consists of raw tweets that may contain noise like URLs, user mentions, hashtags, special characters, and common stopwords. To prepare the data for sentiment analysis, a custom Python function was written to clean the text. This function converts all characters to lowercase, removes unwanted symbols and links, tokenizes the words using NLTK’s word_tokenize, and filters out English stopwords. The cleaned text forms the basis for accurate sentiment scoring.

📊 Sentiment Scoring with VADER
The cleaned tweet text is analyzed using NLTK’s SentimentIntensityAnalyzer, which provides four sentiment scores for each tweet: negative (neg), neutral (neu), positive (pos), and a composite compound score. The compound score is especially useful for determining the overall sentiment of a tweet. Based on this score, each tweet is classified into one of three sentiment categories: Positive (compound > 0.05), Negative (compound < -0.05), or Neutral (compound between -0.05 and 0.05).

📈 Visualization and Insights
To better understand the distribution of sentiments in the dataset, visualizations were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn. A bar chart shows the number of tweets falling into each sentiment category. Additionally, sample tweets from each category—positive, negative, and neutral—are displayed for qualitative insight. These visuals help convey the emotional landscape of the tweets in a quick and intuitive way.

🚀 Getting Started
To run this project locally, clone the repository and install the required Python libraries including nltk, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Make sure to download the necessary NLTK data files such as punkt, stopwords, and vader_lexicon. Then, load your CSV file containing tweets, clean the text, analyze sentiment, and visualize the output.

🤝 Contribution
Contributions to enhance this project are welcome. Whether it's optimizing the cleaning function, integrating different sentiment analysis models, or improving the visualizations—feel free to fork the repository and create a pull request.
